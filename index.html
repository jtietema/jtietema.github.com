  <p>Last week I have been busy moving my development environment from my laptop to a virtual server running on my laptop. This my seem like a hassle and the advantages are not all obvious, so I would like to share my findings and the specifics of my setup that I settled on.</p>

<h3>Security / Privacy</h3>


<p>First I would like to point out the problems I had with my current setup.The most urgent concern I had was that if my laptop would get stolen all my projects would be out in the open. I use the laptop primarily for my company projects and thus contains at lot of information from my clients. Think about copies of a database with maybe lots of user account information. It would be bad if my company would be responsible for the leaking of private information of other company&#8217;s. It is clear that I needed a way to protect my information (probably encryption), but I didn&#8217;t want it to get to much in my way.</p>

<h3>It should just work</h3>


<p>My primary OS is Archlinux. As a desktop OS it suits my needs just fine. I like to tweak things and it runs very fast. On the other hand I am very used to Ubuntu and typically setting up a LAMP environment is less work on Ubuntu that it is on Archlinux. It also matches better with the servers we deploy on and the other developers are also Ubuntu users.</p>

<p>Most important my development environment should just work ALWAYS! I&#8217;ve had some occasions that I reinstalled my system and forgot to install some tools only to discover at an appointment with a client. Not good&#8230; Isolating the development environment from my host OS enables me to chose a different environment and also allows me to preserve it during reinstalls of the host OS.</p>

<h2>The setup</h2>


<p>Enough blabla, on with the details. For virtualization I used <a title="Virtualbox" href="http://virtualbox.org">Virtualbox</a>. I haven&#8217;t used anything else and directly admit I use it for its simplicity. As a guest OS I use <a title="Ubuntu server" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-server">Ubuntu Server</a>. I installed it with encrypted LVM. This way all data inside the virtual server is encrypted (and thus sort of safe). This safes me from all the trouble of keeping track where my database is stored and where my documentroot is from the webserver and if they are exposed or not.</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>


<p>So far all has been nice. But I can&#8217;t use my virtual server without access to it. There are a number of options to try and I will discuss 2 possible setups.</p>

<p>First I went for bridged networking. This way the virtual server will appear in the same network as the host. This is quite flexible and only has two problems. The first being that it is not always good to have your virtual server accessible for the hole network (for instance when connecting directly to the internet or hotel wireless). Second is more of a bug and that is that it just not always works on all networks. Some routers just don&#8217;t seem to get it when two operating systems request an ip from one physical network card.</p>

<p>To solve the to issues a made a second setup. This time I configure two network cards on the virtual server. One uses NAT and is primarily for internet access. The second uses host-only networking and is used by myself for accessing the virtual server. This has some advantages. First being that it works on buggy routers and second, it makes the network layout much more predictable as you have your own internal network address space. This allows you to hard code the network addresses in scripts. The only disadvantage of this setup is that other computers can&#8217;t access the server.</p>

<p>At the moment I use the second solution. Maybe I will switch the NAT to bridged networking when the routers allow it, but I&#8217;m not sure if I will need it. The host only network is great and saves me the trouble of looking up the ip from my server every time. I can now use a script to mount the document root using NFS.</p>

<p>Hope this was useful comments are welcome.</p>

<p>cheers.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s about time I started blogging about my game projects. As part of a research semester for my study I&#8217;m building some prototype games to explore game development in Python. Our first one, <a title="Pyrio" href="http://tietema.net/pyrio">Pyrio</a>, is already done and turned out to be quite nice. The second, <a title="Tank-battle" href="http://bitbucket.org/jtietema/tank-battle/">tank-battle</a>, is lagging a bit behind our own expectations but is nevertheless quite nice, though I don&#8217;t plan to do all the packaging stuff for this one.</p>

<p>Pyrio is a Mario clone. It uses graphics and sounds from <a title="Secret Maryo Chronicals" href="http://www.secretmaryo.org/">Secret Maryo Chronicals</a> and is written with <a title="Pygame" href="http://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a>. One of our findings was that rendering with Pygame was much to slow so for Tank-battle we started using <a title="Cocos2d" href="http://www.cocos2d.org">Cocos2d</a> / <a title="Pyglet" href="http://www.pyglet.org">Pyglet</a>. Tank-battle is not really a game but more a tech-demo. It plays with networking and AI. The networking part is built on top of Twisted and works quite well. We even built some interpolation code on the client which makes prevents opponents from jittering around the screen. We are now in the process of building some path finding into some computer players and make them do smart things. But time is almost up as tomorrow will be the last day of development and we ain&#8217;t got anything battle related, so it&#8217;s just tanks for now ;-)</p>

<p>In the upcoming weeks we will build a 3D prototype, participate in the <a title="Pyweek" href="http://www.pyweek.org">Pyweek</a> and further develop our Pyweek game afterwards. In the meantime, try <a title="Pyrio" href="http://tietema.net/pyrio">Pyrio</a> ;-)</p>

  <p>Revived my blog today. It seems my servage account got hacked and some worm destroyed my index.php file. <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?q=servage+hacked">A quick google search</a> revealed that I am certainly not the first.</p>

<p>Time to start thinking about new hosting as this is probably not going to end any time soon.</p>

<p>I was thinking about runnig my own vps so I can also run other services. Anyone (other) suggestions?</p>

  <p>Just wanted to let everyone know that I use <a title="My code on Launchpad" href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jtietema">Launchpad</a> now to host my personal projects. On Launchpad you have your own personal +junk project in which you can host branches that do not belong to a project on Launchpad. In other words it is a perfect playground for little pet-projects. :-)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a Sub Hunt game lately. It has been amazing how quick you can get a game together with python and pygame. At the time of writing a spend about 4 hours on the game. It is off course very basic and far from finished. But in another 2 - 4 hours it can be almost done. At the moment it contains only three levels, but creating levels is as simple as defining which and how much submarines are in the level.</p>

<p>So <a title="Subhunt" href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jtietema/subhunt/trunk">check it out</a> and let me know what you think. Ideas on how to expand the game are most welcome. :-)</p>

  <p>So nearly another month has passed and I&#8217;ve been busy with quite a lot of different things. First my tagging add-on for Hippo ECM is coming along nicely. You can add tags to a document and it pops-up some suggestions beneath them (they aren&#8217;t really good suggestions yet but they are there).</p>

<p>To test my tagging add-on I needed some content so I wrote a converter which converts a Wikipedia XML dump into a XML import for Hippo ECM. The script takes the number of articles you want to create in the import as an argument, so I now have imports ranging from a hundred articles to about a hundred thousand articles.</p>

<p>My third project for this month was to create a tag cloud which would enable a user to browse documents by tag.</p>

<p>So after all these details I bring you: The Screenshot :-) (click for a larger version)</p>

<p><a href="/images/tagcloud2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-40" title="Tag cloud" src="/images/tagcloud2-300x114.png" alt="Tagging in Hippo ECM" width="300" height="114" /></a></p>

<p>On the left is the tag cloud (needs some layout work still), the center shows the documents with the tag &#8220;Living people&#8221; and the lower right shows current tags and suggestions belonging to the document.</p>

<p>The suggestion system is quite dumb. It suggests the most common tags at the moment. The coming weeks I will work on a more smart suggestion system. I plan to experiment with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>searching tags related to the already assigned tags.</li>
    <li>searching for existing tags in document body and title</li>
    <li>searching for tags from embedded documents (images, download-able documents, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Enough for now. I need to get back to work :-)</p>

  <p>So whats become of me lately? Some of you mite not have heard much of me since the holidays.</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;m still here. I&#8217;m busy with my internship at Hippo at the moment, so I thought it might be nice to give a headsup on what I am doing here exactly. :-) My internship started back in september and since then I&#8217;ve spend quite some time on getting to know the Hippo ECM code base and getting used to Wicket. To accomplish that I wrote a few frontend plug-ins for Hippo ECM. See below for a list of screenshots. Some of them actually got demo&#8217;ed. :-)</p>

<p><img title="Colleague Tracker" src="http://colleaguetrack.forge.hippo-ecm.org/images/colleaguetracker.png" alt="Shows a list of recent user activity" width="546" height="270" /></p>

<p><img title="Last 5 Images" src="http://lastimages.forge.hippo-ecm.org/images/lastimages.png" alt="Show the last 5 uploaden images" width="551" height="257" /></p>

<p>During my internship I will write a bigger plug-in. This plug-in will assist users with assigning good keywords (tags) to their content. Basically it will look for related content and suggest the most common keywords from all related content. The system will not create new keywords, but instead feed on the collection of keywords already assigned to the content. No real AI there but more like &#8220;Collective Intelligence&#8221;.</p>

<p>The challenge is making the performance impact minimal. I will be doing al lot of queries to the backend (Jackrabbit repository) and I don&#8217;t want to hammer the thing when just searching for some tags :-)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post some more screenshots and updates soon, for now my blog software is a bit broken (can&#8217;t upload images to my own server and preview post some how seems broken too). I suspect it has something to do with some server reorganisations @ servage some time ago :-(</p>

  <p>What does one do when he is bored? Write a wordpress plugin. I wanted to update my blog for some time now with my ZCE logo, so I thought why not write a plugin to do so. I noticed that there was a text widget, which doesn&#8217;t make it much harder to update your site with the logo, but that is no fun so <a title="ZCE widget" href="/zce-widget">here is a special ZCE widget</a>.</p>

<p>Feedback is most welcome. Enjoy.</p>

  <p>So it&#8217;s been to long since my last update. I&#8217;ve been quite busy with my study as the vacation approaches. Below I&#8217;ll sum up some things that have kept me busy.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Zend Certification: I passed, as most of you know by now. Will have to find time to integrate a button/link to <a title="My Profile" href="http://www.zend.com/store/education/certification/authenticate.php?ClientCandidateID=ZEND007565&amp;RegistrationID=225069027">my profile in the Zend yellow pages</a>.</li>
    <li>Hardware &amp; KDE: I&#8217;ve received my new computer I ordered from <a title="ZaReason" href="http://www.zareason.de/">ZaReason</a> and it is awesome. I installed KDE 4.1 beta 1 and am very happy with how well it runs. Only Konqueror and Dolphin crash a lot, but that will probably to improve over time. In the meantime, Firefox 3 and Opera 9.5 do the job just fine.</li>
    <li>Voidwalkers: As the pressure of incoming projects and stuff is dropping, we finally have some time to think of new innovative things. We exploring the possibilities of generating Zend Framework applications. At the moment we have a small plugin based command-line application and have some handy plugins that make our live easier. For instance we can generate a project structure (directories and so) and we can generate table classes from the database (with relations). So that&#8217;s pretty cool. So controllers and views with basic form operations are next :-)</li>
    <li>Study: I&#8217;ve had my last exams. Will have to finish my last assignments the next two weeks. After the summer I will start my internship at <a title="Hippo" href="http://www.hippo.nl">hippo</a>. I&#8217;m really looking forward to that as the company looks really as a nice place to work. Will post some more updates as the appear.</li>
</ul>


<p>So some things I am looking forward to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Vacation! Relaxation and road tripping with my girlfriend.</li>
    <li>KDE 4.1 Release @ 29 July. KDE 4 will finally be ready for general purpose use.</li>
    <li>More time to work on personal projects.</li>
</ul>


<p>So time for me to get productive again. :-)</p>
